/** The `hx-boost` attribute allows you to "boost" normal anchors and form tags to use AJAX instead.  This
  * has the [nice fallback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) that, if the user does not
  * have javascript enabled, the site will continue to work.
  *
  * For anchor tags, clicking on the anchor will issue a `GET` request to the url specified in the `href` and
  * will push the url so that a history entry is created.  The target is the `<body>` tag, and the `innerHTML`
  * swap strategy is used by default.  All of these can be modified by using the appropriate attributes, except
  * the `click` trigger.
  *
  * For forms the request will be converted into a `GET` or `POST`, based on the method in the `method` attribute
  * and will be triggered by a `submit`.  Again, the target will be the `body` of the page, and the `innerHTML`
  * swap will be used. The url will _not_ be pushed, however, and no history entry will be created. (You can use the
  * [hx-push-url](@/attributes/hx-push-url.md) attribute if you want the url to be pushed.)
  *
  * Here is an example of some boosted links:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-boost="true">
  *   <a href="/page1">Go To Page 1</a>
  *   <a href="/page2">Go To Page 2</a>
  * </div>
  * ```
  * These links will issue an ajax `GET` request to the respective URLs and replace the body's inner content with it.
  *
  * Here is an example of a boosted form:
  *
  * ```html
  * <form hx-boost="true" action="/example" method="post">
  *     <input name="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter email...">
  *     <button>Submit</button>
  * </form>
  * ```
  * This form will issue an ajax `POST` to the given URL and replace the body's inner content with it.
  *
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-boost` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  * * Only links that are to the same domain and that are not local anchors will be boosted
  * * All requests are done via AJAX, so keep that in mind when doing things like redirects
  * * To find out if the request results from a boosted anchor or form, look for [`HX-Boosted`](@/reference.md#request_headers) in the request header
  * * Selectively disable boost on child elements with `hx-boost="false"`
  * * Disable the replacement of elements via boost, and their children, with [`hx-preserve="true"`](@/attributes/hx-preserve.md)

  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-confirm` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  * * `hx-confirm` uses the browser's `window.confirm` by default. You can customize this behavior as shown [in this example](@/examples/confirm.md).

  * * `this` to disable the element itself
  * * `closest <CSS selector>` which will find the [closest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
  *   ancestor element or itself, that matches the given CSS selector
  *   (e.g. `closest fieldset` will disable the closest to the element `fieldset`).
  * * `find <CSS selector>` which will find the first child descendant element that matches the given CSS selector
  * * `next` which resolves to [element.nextElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/nextElementSibling)
  * * `next <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM forward for the first element that matches the given CSS selector
  *   (e.g. `next button` will disable the closest following sibling `button` element)
  * * `previous` which resolves to [element.previousElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/previousElementSibling)
  * * `previous <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM backwards for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *   (e.g. `previous input` will disable the closest previous sibling `input` element)
  *
  * Here is an example with a button that will disable itself during a request:
  *
  * ```html
  * <button hx-post="/example" hx-disabled-elt="this">

  *
  * ## Security Considerations
  *
  * * By default, the value of `hx-headers` must be valid [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON).

  *
  * * Whilst far from being a foolproof solution to [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf), the `hx-headers` attribute can support backend services to provide [CSRF prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html). For more information see the [CSRF Prevention](https://htmx.org/docs/#csrf-prevention) section.

/** The `hx-include` attribute allows you to include additional element values in an AJAX request. The value of this

  * * `closest <CSS selector>` which will find the [closest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
  *   ancestor element or itself, that matches the given CSS selector
  *   (e.g. `closest tr` will target the closest table row to the element).
  * * `find <CSS selector>` which will find the first child descendant element that matches the given CSS selector.
  * * `next <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM forward for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *   (e.g. `next .error` will target the closest following sibling element with `error` class)
  * * `previous <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM backwards for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *   (e.g. `previous .error` will target the closest previous sibling with `error` class)
  *
  * Here is an example that includes a separate input value:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *     <button hx-post="/register" hx-include="[name='email']">
  *         Register!
  *     </button>
  *     Enter email: <input name="email" type="email"/>
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * This is a little contrived as you would typically enclose both of these elements in a `form` and submit
  * the value automatically, but it demonstrates the concept.
  *
  * Note that if you include a non-input element, all input elements enclosed in that element will be included.
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-include` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  * * While `hx-include` is inherited, it is evaluated from the element triggering the request. It is easy to get confused
  *   when working with the extended selectors such as `find` and `closest`.
  *   ```html
  *   <div hx-include="find input">
  *       <button hx-post="/register">
  *           Register!
  *       </button>
  *       Enter email: <input name="email" type="email"/>
  *   </div>
  *   ```
  *   In the above example, when clicking on the button, the `find input` selector is resolved from the button itself, which
  *   does not return any element here, since the button doesn't have any `input` child, thus in this case, raises an error.
  * * A standard CSS selector resolves
  *   to [document.querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) and will include
  *   multiple elements, while the extended selectors such as `find` or `next` only return a single element at most to
  *   include
  */
final val include: Attr = hx("include")

/** The `hx-indicator` attribute allows you to specify the element that will have the `htmx-request` class
  * added to it for the duration of the request. This can be used to show spinners or progress indicators
  * while the request is in flight.
  *
  * The value of this attribute is a CSS query selector of the element or elements to apply the class to,
  * or the keyword [`closest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest), followed by a CSS selector,
  * which will find the closest ancestor element or itself, that matches the given CSS selector (e.g. `closest tr`);
  *
  * Here is an example with a spinner adjacent to the button:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *     <button hx-post="/example" hx-indicator="#spinner">
  *         Post It!
  *     </button>
  *     <img  id="spinner" class="htmx-indicator" src="/img/bars.svg"/>
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * When a request is in flight, this will cause the `htmx-request` class to be added to the `#spinner`
  * image.  The image also has the `htmx-indicator` class on it, which defines an opacity transition
  * that will show the spinner:
  *
  * ```css
  *     .htmx-indicator{
  *         opacity:0;
  *         transition: opacity 500ms ease-in;
  *     }
  *     .htmx-request .htmx-indicator{
  *         opacity:1;
  *     }
  *     .htmx-request.htmx-indicator{
  *         opacity:1;
  *     }
  * ```
  *
  * If you would prefer a different effect for showing the spinner you could define and use your own indicator
  * CSS.  Here is an example that uses `display` rather than opacity (Note that we use `my-indicator` instead of `htmx-indicator`):
  *
  * ```css
  *     .my-indicator{
  *         display:none;
  *     }
  *     .htmx-request .my-indicator{
  *         display:inline;
  *     }
  *     .htmx-request.my-indicator{
  *         display:inline;
  *     }
  * ```
  *
  * Note that the target of the `hx-indicator` selector need not be the exact element that you
  * want to show: it can be any element in the parent hierarchy of the indicator.
  *
  * Finally, note that the `htmx-request` class by default is added to the element causing
  * the request, so you can place an indicator inside of that element and not need to explicitly
  * call it out with the `hx-indicator` attribute:
  *
  * ```html
  * <button hx-post="/example">
  *     Post It!
  *    <img  class="htmx-indicator" src="/img/bars.svg"/>
  * </button>
  * ```
  *
  * ## Demo
  *
  * This simulates what a spinner might look like in that situation:
  *
  * <button class="btn" classes="toggle htmx-request:3s">
  *     Post It!
  *    <img  class="htmx-indicator" src="/img/bars.svg"/>
  * </button>
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-indicator` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  * * In the absence of an explicit indicator, the `htmx-request` class will be added to the element triggering the
  *   request
  * * If you want to use your own CSS but still use `htmx-indicator` as class name, then you need to disable `includeIndicatorStyles`. See [Configuring htmx](@/docs.md#config). The easiest way is to add this to the `<head>` of your HTML:
  * ```html
  * <meta name="htmx-config" content='{"includeIndicatorStyles": false}'>

/** The default behavior for htmx is to "inherit" many attributes automatically: that is, an attribute such as
  * [hx-target](@/attributes/hx-target.md) may be placed on a parent element, and all child elements will inherit
  * that target.  Some people do not like this feature and instead prefer to explicitly specify inheritance for attributes.
  *
  * To support this mode of development, htmx offers the `htmx.config.disableInheritance` setting, which can be set to
  * `true` to prevent inheritance from being the default behavior for any of the htmx attributes.
  *
  * The `hx-inherit` attribute allows you to control the inheritance of attributes manually.
  *
  * htmx evaluates attribute inheritance as follows:
  *
  * * when `hx-inherit` is set on a parent node
  *   * `inherit="*"` all attribute inheritance for this element will be enabled
  *   * `hx-inherit="hx-select hx-get hx-target"` enable inheritance for only one or multiple specified attributes
  *
  * Here is an example of a div that shares an `hx-target` attribute for a set of anchor tags when `htmx.config.disableInheritance`
  * is set to false:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-target="#tab-container" hx-inherit="hx-target">

/** The `hx-on*` attributes allow you to embed scripts inline to respond to events directly on an element; similar to the
  * [`onevent` properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers#using_onevent_properties) found in HTML, such as `onClick`.
  *
  * The `hx-on*` attributes improve upon `onevent` by enabling the handling of any arbitrary JavaScript event,
  * for enhanced [Locality of Behaviour (LoB)](/essays/locality-of-behaviour/) even when dealing with non-standard DOM events. For example, these
  * attributes allow you to handle [htmx events](/reference#events).
  *
  * With `hx-on` attributes, you specify the event name as part of the attribute name, after a colon.  So, for example, if
  * you want to respond to a `click` event, you would use the attribute `hx-on:click`:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-on:click="alert('Clicked!')">Click</div>
  * ```
  *
  * Note that this syntax can be used to capture all htmx events, as well as most other custom events, in addition to the
  * standard DOM events.
  *
  * One gotcha to note is that DOM attributes do not preserve case. This means, unfortunately, an attribute like
  * `hx-on:htmx:beforeRequest` **will not work**, because the DOM lowercases the attribute names.  Fortunately, htmx supports
  * both camel case event names and also [kebab-case event names](@/docs.md#events), so you can use `hx-on:htmx:before-request` instead.
  *
  * In order to make writing htmx-based event handlers a little easier, you can use the shorthand double-colon `hx-on::` for htmx
  * events, and omit the "htmx" part:
  *
  * ```html
  * <!-- These two are equivalent -->
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on:htmx:before-request="alert('Making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  *
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on::before-request="alert('Making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  *
  * ```
  *
  * If you wish to handle multiple different events, you can simply add multiple attributes to an element:
  * ```html
  * <button hx-get="/info"
  *         hx-on::before-request="alert('Making a request!')"
  *         hx-on::after-request="alert('Done making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  * ```
  *
  * Finally, in order to make this feature compatible with some templating languages (e.g. [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx)) that do not like having a colon (`:`)
  * in HTML attributes, you may use dashes in the place of colons for both the long form and the shorthand form:
  *
  * ```html
  * <!-- These two are equivalent -->
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on-htmx-before-request="alert('Making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  *
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on--before-request="alert('Making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  *
  * ```
  *
  * ### hx-on (deprecated)
  * The value is an event name, followed by a colon `:`, followed by the script:
  *
  * ```html
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on="htmx:beforeRequest: alert('Making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  * ```
  *
  * Multiple handlers can be defined by putting them on new lines:
  * ```html
  * <button hx-get="/info" hx-on="htmx:beforeRequest: alert('Making a request!')
  *                               htmx:afterRequest: alert('Done making a request!')">
  *     Get Info!
  * </button>
  * ```
  *
  *
  * ### Symbols
  *
  * Like `onevent`, two symbols are made available to event handler scripts:
  *
  * * `this` - The element on which the `hx-on` attribute is defined
  * * `event` - The event that triggered the handler
  *
  * ### Notes
  *
  * * `hx-on` is _not_ inherited, however due to
  *   [event bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling_and_capture),
  *   `hx-on` attributes on parent elements will typically be triggered by events on child elements
  * * `hx-on:*` and `hx-on` cannot be used together on the same element; if `hx-on:*` is present, the value of an `hx-on` attribute
  *    on the same element will be ignored. The two forms can be mixed in the same document, however.

  * The value of this attribute is comma separated list of elements to be swapped out of band.  This attribute is almost
  * always paired with [hx-select](@/attributes/hx-select.md).
  *
  * Here is an example that selects a subset of the response content:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *    <div id="alert"></div>
  *     <button hx-get="/info"
  *             hx-select="#info-details"

  *         Get Info!
  *     </button>
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * This button will issue a `GET` to `/info` and then select the element with the id `info-details`,
  * which will replace the entire button in the DOM, and, in addition, pick out an element with the id `alert`
  * in the response and swap it in for div in the DOM with the same ID.
  *
  * Each value in the comma separated list of values can specify any valid [`hx-swap`](@/attributes/hx-swap.md)
  * strategy by separating the selector and the swap strategy with a `:`.
  *

  *
  * ```html

  *     <button hx-get="/info"
  *             hx-select="#info-details"

/** The `hx-swap-oob` attribute allows you to specify that some content in a response should be
  * swapped into the DOM somewhere other than the target, that is "Out of Band".  This allows you to piggyback updates to other element updates on a response.
  *
  * Consider the following response HTML:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *  ...
  * </div>
  * <div id="alerts" hx-swap-oob="true">
  *     Saved!
  * </div>
  *
  * ```
  *
  * The first div will be swapped into the target the usual manner.  The second div, however, will be swapped in as a replacement for the element with the id `alerts`, and will not end up in the target.
  *
  * The value of the `hx-swap-oob` can be:
  *
  * * `true`
  * * any valid [`hx-swap`](@/attributes/hx-swap.md) value
  * * any valid [`hx-swap`](@/attributes/hx-swap.md) value, followed by a colon, followed by a CSS selector
  *
  * If the value is `true` or `outerHTML` (which are equivalent) the element will be swapped inline.
  *
  * If a swap value is given, that swap strategy will be used and the encapsulating tag pair will be stripped for all strategies other than `outerHTML`.
  *
  * If a selector is given, all elements matched by that selector will be swapped.  If not, the element with an ID matching the new content will be swapped.
  *
  * ### Using alternate swap strategies
  *
  * As mentioned previously when using swap strategies other than `true` or `outerHTML` the encapsulating tags are stripped, as such you need to excapsulate the returned data with the correct tags for the context.
  *
  * When trying to insert a `<tr>` in a table that uses `<tbody>`:
  * ```html
  * <tbody hx-swap-oob="beforeend:#table tbody">
  * 	<tr>
  * 		...
  * 	</tr>
  * </tbody>
  * ```
  *
  * A "plain" table:
  * ```html
  * <table hx-swap-oob="beforeend:#table2">
  * 	<tr>
  * 		...
  * 	</tr>
  * </table>
  * ```
  *
  * A `<li>` may be encapsulated in `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<div>` or `<span>`, for example:
  * ```html
  * <ul hx-swap-oob="beforeend:#list1">
  * 	<li>...</li>
  * </ul>
  * ```
  *
  * A `<p>` can be encapsulated in `<div>` or `<span>`:
  * ```html
  * <span hx-swap-oob="beforeend:#text">
  * 	<p>...</p>
  * </span>
  * ```
  *
  * ### Troublesome Tables and lists
  *
  * Note that you can use a `template` tag to encapsulate types of elements that, by the HTML spec, can't stand on their own in the
  * DOM (`<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<colgroup>`, `<caption>`, `<col>` & `<li>`).
  *
  * Here is an example with an out-of-band swap of a table row being encapsulated in this way:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *     ...
  * </div>
  * <template>
  *     <tr id="row" hx-swap-oob="true">
  *         ...
  *     </tr>
  * </template>
  * ```
  *
  * Note that these template tags will be removed from the final content of the page.
  *
  * ### Slippery SVGs
  *
  * Some element types, like SVG, use a specific XML namespace for their child elements. This prevents internal elements from working correctly when swapped in, unless they are encapsulated within a `svg` tag. To modify the internal contents of an existing SVG, you can use both `template` and `svg` tags to encapsulate the elements, allowing them to get the correct namespace applied.
  *
  * Here is an example with an out-of-band swap of svg elements being encapsulated in this way:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *     ...
  * </div>
  * <template><svg>
  *     <circle hx-swap-oob="true" id="circle1" r="35" cx="50" cy="50" fill="red" />
  * </svg></template>
  * <template><svg hx-swap-oob="beforebegin:#circle1">
  *     <circle id="circle2" r="45" cx="50" cy="50" fill="blue" />
  * </svg></template>
  * ```
  * This will replace circle1 inline and then insert circle2 before circle1.
  *
  * Note that these `template` and `svg` wrapping tags will be removed from the final content of the page.
  *
  * ## Nested OOB Swaps
  *
  * By default, any element with `hx-swap-oob=` attribute anywhere in the response is processed for oob swap behavior, including when an element is nested within the main response element.
  * This can be problematic when using [template fragments](https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/) where a fragment may be reused as an oob-swap target and also as part of a bigger fragment. When the bigger fragment is the main response the inner fragment will still be processed as an oob swap, removing it from the dom.
  *
  * This behavior can be changed by setting the config `htmx.config.allowNestedOobSwaps` to `false`. If this config option is `false`, OOB swaps are only processed when the element is *adjacent to* the main response element, OOB swaps elsewhere will be ignored and oob-swap-related attributes stripped.
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-swap-oob` is not inherited
  */
final val swapOob: Attr = hx("swap-oob")

/** The `hx-swap` attribute allows you to specify how the response will be swapped in relative to the
  * [target](@/attributes/hx-target.md) of an AJAX request. If you do not specify the option, the default is
  * `htmx.config.defaultSwapStyle` (`innerHTML`).
  *
  * The possible values of this attribute are:
  *
  * * `innerHTML` - Replace the inner html of the target element
  * * `outerHTML` - Replace the entire target element with the response
  * * `textContent` - Replace the text content of the target element, without parsing the response as HTML
  * * `beforebegin` - Insert the response before the target element
  * * `afterbegin` - Insert the response before the first child of the target element
  * * `beforeend` - Insert the response after the last child of the target element
  * * `afterend` - Insert the response after the target element
  * * `delete` - Deletes the target element regardless of the response
  * * `none`- Does not append content from response (out of band items will still be processed).
  *
  * These options are based on standard DOM naming and the
  * [`Element.insertAdjacentHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML)
  * specification.
  *
  * So in this code:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="afterend">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
  * ```
  *
  * The `div` will issue a request to `/example` and append the returned content after the `div`
  *
  * ### Modifiers
  *
  * The `hx-swap` attributes supports modifiers for changing the behavior of the swap.  They are outlined below.
  *
  * #### Transition: `transition`
  *
  * If you want to use the new [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) API
  * when a swap occurs, you can use the `transition:true` option for your swap.  You can also enable this feature globally by
  * setting the `htmx.config.globalViewTransitions` config setting to `true`.
  *
  * #### Timing: `swap` & `settle`
  *
  * You can modify the amount of time that htmx will wait after receiving a response to swap the content
  * by including a `swap` modifier:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML swap:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
  * ```
  *
  * Similarly, you can modify the time between the swap and the settle logic by including a `settle`
  * modifier:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this will wait 1s before doing the swap after it is received -->
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-swap="innerHTML settle:1s">Get Some HTML & Append It</div>
  * ```
  *
  * These attributes can be used to synchronize htmx with the timing of CSS transition effects.
  *
  * #### Title: `ignoreTitle`
  *
  * By default, htmx will update the title of the page if it finds a `<title>` tag in the response content.  You can turn
  * off this behavior by setting the `ignoreTitle` option to true.
  *
  * #### Scrolling: `scroll` & `show`
  *
  * You can also change the scrolling behavior of the target element by using the `scroll` and `show` modifiers, both
  * of which take the values `top` and `bottom`:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this fixed-height div will scroll to the bottom of the div after content is appended -->
  *   <div style="height:200px; overflow: scroll"
  *        hx-get="/example"
  *        hx-swap="beforeend scroll:bottom">
  *      Get Some HTML & Append It & Scroll To Bottom
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this will get some content and add it to #another-div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the
  *        viewport -->
  *   <div hx-get="/example"
  *        hx-swap="innerHTML show:top"
  *        hx-target="#another-div">
  *     Get Some Content
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * If you wish to target a different element for scrolling or showing, you may place a CSS selector after the `scroll:`
  * or `show:`, followed by `:top` or `:bottom`:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the top of #another-div is visible in the
  *        viewport -->
  *   <div hx-get="/example"
  *        hx-swap="innerHTML show:#another-div:top">
  *     Get Some Content
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * You may also use `window:top` and `window:bottom` to scroll to the top and bottom of the current window.
  *
  *
  * ```html
  *   <!-- this will get some content and swap it into the current div, then ensure that the viewport is scrolled to the
  *        very top -->
  *   <div hx-get="/example"
  *        hx-swap="innerHTML show:window:top">
  *     Get Some Content
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * For boosted links and forms the default behaviour is `show:top`. You can disable it globally with
  * [htmx.config.scrollIntoViewOnBoost](@/api.md#config) or you can use `hx-swap="show:none"` on an element basis.
  *
  * ```html
  * <form action="/example" hx-swap="show:none">
  *   ...
  * </form>
  * ```
  *
  * #### Focus scroll
  *
  * htmx preserves focus between requests for inputs that have a defined id attribute. By default htmx prevents auto-scrolling to focused inputs between requests which can be unwanted behavior on longer requests when the user has already scrolled away. To enable focus scroll you can use `focus-scroll:true`.
  *
  * ```html
  *   <input id="name" hx-get="/validation"
  *        hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:true"/>
  * ```
  *
  * Alternatively, if you want the page to automatically scroll to the focused element after each request you can change the htmx global configuration value `htmx.config.defaultFocusScroll` to true. Then disable it for specific requests using `focus-scroll:false`.
  *
  * ```html
  *   <input id="name" hx-get="/validation"
  *        hx-swap="outerHTML focus-scroll:false"/>
  * ```
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-swap` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  * * The default value of this attribute is `innerHTML`
  * * Due to DOM limitations, it’s not possible to use the `outerHTML` method on the `<body>` element.
  *   htmx will change `outerHTML` on `<body>` to use `innerHTML`.
  * * The default swap delay is 0ms
  * * The default settle delay is 20ms

/** The `hx-sync` attribute allows you to synchronize AJAX requests between multiple elements.
  *
  * The `hx-sync` attribute consists of a CSS selector to indicate the element to synchronize on, followed optionally
  * by a colon and then by an optional syncing strategy.  The available strategies are:
  *
  * * `drop` - drop (ignore) this request if an existing request is in flight (the default)
  * * `abort` - drop (ignore) this request if an existing request is in flight, and, if that is not the case,
  *             *abort* this request if another request occurs while it is still in flight
  * * `replace` - abort the current request, if any, and replace it with this request
  * * `queue` - place this request in the request queue associated with the given element
  *
  * The `queue` modifier can take an additional argument indicating exactly how to queue:
  *
  * * `queue first` - queue the first request to show up while a request is in flight
  * * `queue last` - queue the last request to show up while a request is in flight
  * * `queue all` - queue all requests that show up while a request is in flight
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-sync` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  *
  * This example resolves a race condition between a form's submit request and an individual input's validation request. Normally, without using `hx-sync`, filling out the input and immediately submitting the form triggers two parallel requests to `/validate` and `/store`. Using `hx-sync="closest form:abort"` on the input will watch for requests on the form and abort the input's request if a form request is present or starts while the input request is in flight.
  *
  * ```html
  * <form hx-post="/store">
  *     <input id="title" name="title" type="text"
  *         hx-post="/validate"
  *         hx-trigger="change"
  *         hx-sync="closest form:abort">
  *     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  * </form>
  * ```
  *
  * If you'd rather prioritize the validation request over the submit request, you can use the `drop` strategy. This example will prioritize the validation request over the submit request so that if a validation request is in flight, the form cannot be submitted.
  *
  * ```html
  * <form hx-post="/store">
  *     <input id="title" name="title" type="text"
  *         hx-post="/validate"
  *         hx-trigger="change"
  *         hx-sync="closest form:drop"
  *     >
  *     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  * </form>
  * ```
  *
  * When dealing with forms that contain many inputs, you can prioritize the submit request over all input validation requests using the hx-sync `replace` strategy on the form tag. This will cancel any in-flight validation requests and issue only the `hx-post="/store"` request. If you'd rather abort the submit request and prioritize any existing validation requests you can use the `hx-sync="this:abort"` strategy on the form tag.
  *
  * ```html
  * <form hx-post="/store" hx-sync="this:replace">
  *     <input id="title" name="title" type="text" hx-post="/validate" hx-trigger="change" />
  *     <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  * </form>
  * ```
  *
  * When implementing active search functionality the hx-trigger attribute's `delay` modifier can be used to debounce the user's input and avoid making multiple requests while the user types. However, once a request is made, if the user begins typing again a new request will begin even if the previous one has not finished processing. This example will cancel any in-flight requests and use only the last request. In cases where the search input is contained within the target, then using `hx-sync` like this also helps reduce the chances that the input will be replaced while the user is still typing.
  *
  * ```html
  * <input type="search"
  *     hx-get="/search"
  *     hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:500ms, search"
  *     hx-target="#search-results"
  *     hx-sync="this:replace">
  * ```
  */
final val sync: Attr = hx("sync")

/** The `hx-target` attribute allows you to target a different element for swapping than the one issuing the AJAX
  * request.  The value of this attribute can be:
  *
  * * A CSS query selector of the element to target.
  * * `this` which indicates that the element that the `hx-target` attribute is on is the target.
  * * `closest <CSS selector>` which will find the [closest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest)
  *   ancestor element or itself, that matches the given CSS selector
  *   (e.g. `closest tr` will target the closest table row to the element).
  * * `find <CSS selector>` which will find the first child descendant element that matches the given CSS selector.
  * * `next` which resolves to [element.nextElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/nextElementSibling)
  * * `next <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM forward for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *   (e.g. `next .error` will target the closest following sibling element with `error` class)
  * * `previous` which resolves to [element.previousElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/previousElementSibling)
  * * `previous <CSS selector>` which will scan the DOM backwards for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *   (e.g. `previous .error` will target the closest previous sibling with `error` class)
  *
  *
  * Here is an example that targets a div:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div>
  *     <div id="response-div"></div>
  *     <button hx-post="/register" hx-target="#response-div" hx-swap="beforeend">
  *         Register!
  *     </button>
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * The response from the `/register` url will be appended to the `div` with the id `response-div`.
  *
  * This example uses `hx-target="this"` to make a link that updates itself when clicked:
  * ```html
  * <a hx-post="/new-link" hx-target="this" hx-swap="outerHTML">New link</a>
  * ```
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-target` is inherited and can be placed on a parent element
  */
final val target: Attr = hx("target")

/** The `hx-trigger` attribute allows you to specify what triggers an AJAX request.  A trigger
  * value can be one of the following:
  *
  * * An event name (e.g. "click" or "my-custom-event") followed by an event filter and a set of event modifiers
  * * A polling definition of the form `every <timing declaration>`
  * * A comma-separated list of such events
  *
  * ### Standard Events
  *
  * Standard events refer to [web API events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events) (e.g. click, keydown, mouseup, load).
  *
  * A standard event, such as `click` can be specified as the trigger like so:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/clicked" hx-trigger="click">Click Me</div>
  * ```
  *
  * #### Standard Event Filters
  *
  * Events can be filtered by enclosing a boolean javascript expression in square brackets after the event name.  If
  * this expression evaluates to `true` the event will be triggered, otherwise it will be ignored. Standard event filters [require eval](@/docs.md#configuration-options).
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/clicked" hx-trigger="click[ctrlKey]">Control Click Me</div>
  * ```
  *
  * This event will trigger if a click event is triggered with the `event.ctrlKey` property set to true.
  *
  * Conditions can also refer to global functions or state
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/clicked" hx-trigger="click[checkGlobalState()]">Control Click Me</div>
  * ```
  *
  * And can also be combined using the standard javascript syntax
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/clicked" hx-trigger="click[ctrlKey&&shiftKey]">Control-Shift Click Me</div>
  * ```
  *
  * Note that all symbols used in the expression will be resolved first against the triggering event, and then next
  * against the global namespace, so `myEvent[foo]` will first look for a property named `foo` on the event, then look
  * for a global symbol with the name `foo`
  *
  * #### Standard Event Modifiers
  *
  * Standard events can also have modifiers that change how they behave.  The modifiers are:
  *
  * * `once` - the event will only trigger once (e.g. the first click)
  * * `changed` - the event will only change if the value of the element has changed. Please pay attention `change` is the name of the event and `changed` is the name of the modifier.
  * * `delay:<timing declaration>` - a delay will occur before an event triggers a request.  If the event
  * is seen again it will reset the delay.
  * * `throttle:<timing declaration>` - a throttle will occur after an event triggers a request. If the event
  * is seen again before the delay completes, it is ignored, the element will trigger at the end of the delay.
  * * `from:<Extended CSS selector>` - allows the event that triggers a request to come from another element in the document (e.g. listening to a key event on the body, to support hot keys)
  *   * A standard CSS selector resolves to all elements matching that selector. Thus, `from:input` would listen on every input on the page.
  *   * The CSS selector is only evaluated once and is not re-evaluated when the page changes. If you need to detect dynamically added elements use a [standard event filter](#standard-event-filters), for example `hx-trigger="click[event.target.matches('button')] from:body"` which would [catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Event_bubbling) click events from every button on the page.
  *   * The extended CSS selector here allows for the following non-standard CSS values:
  *     * `document` - listen for events on the document
  *     * `window` - listen for events on the window
  *     * `closest <CSS selector>` - finds the [closest](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/closest) ancestor element or itself, matching the given css selector
  *     * `find <CSS selector>` - finds the closest child matching the given css selector
  *     * `next` resolves to [element.nextElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/nextElementSibling)
  *     * `next <CSS selector>` scans the DOM forward for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *       (e.g. `next .error` will target the closest following sibling element with `error` class)
  *     * `previous` resolves to [element.previousElementSibling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element/previousElementSibling)
  *     * `previous <CSS selector>` scans the DOM backwards for the first element that matches the given CSS selector.
  *       (e.g. `previous .error` will target the closest previous sibling with `error` class)
  * * `target:<CSS selector>` - allows you to filter via a CSS selector on the target of the event.  This can be useful when you want to listen for
  * triggers from elements that might not be in the DOM at the point of initialization, by, for example, listening on the body,
  * but with a target filter for a child element
  * * `consume` - if this option is included the event will not trigger any other htmx requests on parents (or on elements
  *   listening on parents)
  * * `queue:<queue option>` - determines how events are queued if an event occurs while a request for another event is in flight.  Options are:
  *   * `first` - queue the first event
  *   * `last` - queue the last event (default)
  *   * `all` - queue all events (issue a request for each event)
  *   * `none` - do not queue new events
  *
  * Here is an example of a search box that searches on `keyup`, but only if the search value has changed
  * and the user hasn't typed anything new for 1 second:
  *
  * ```html
  * <input name="q"
  *        hx-get="/search" hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:1s"
  *        hx-target="#search-results"/>
  * ```
  *
  * The response from the `/search` url will be appended to the `div` with the id `search-results`.
  *
  * ### Non-standard Events
  *
  * There are some additional non-standard events that htmx supports:
  *
  * * `load` - triggered on load (useful for lazy-loading something)
  * * `revealed` - triggered when an element is scrolled into the viewport (also useful for lazy-loading). If you are using `overflow` in css like `overflow-y: scroll` you should use `intersect once` instead of `revealed`.
  * * `intersect` - fires once when an element first intersects the viewport.  This supports two additional options:
  *     * `root:<selector>` - a CSS selector of the root element for intersection
  *     * `threshold:<float>` - a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating what amount of intersection to fire the event on
  *
  * ### Triggering via the `HX-Trigger` header
  *
  * If you're trying to fire an event from <code>HX-Trigger</code> response  header, you will likely want to
  * use the `from:body` modifier.  E.g. if you send a header like this <code>HX-Trigger: my-custom-event</code>
  * with a response, an element would likely need to look like this:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-trigger="my-custom-event from:body">
  *     Triggered by HX-Trigger header...
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * in order to fire.
  *
  * This is because the header will likely trigger the event in a different DOM hierarchy than the element that you
  * wish to be triggered.  For a similar reason, you will often listen for hot keys from the body.
  *
  * ### Polling
  *
  * By using the syntax `every <timing declaration>` you can have an element poll periodically:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/latest_updates" hx-trigger="every 1s">
  *   Nothing Yet!
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * This example will issue a `GET` to the `/latest_updates` URL every second and swap the results into
  * the innerHTML of this div.
  *
  * If you want to add a filter to polling, it should be added *after* the poll declaration:
  *
  * ```html
  * <div hx-get="/latest_updates" hx-trigger="every 1s [someConditional]">
  *   Nothing Yet!
  * </div>
  * ```
  *
  * ### Multiple Triggers
  *
  * Multiple triggers can be provided, separated by commas.  Each trigger gets its own options.
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/news" hx-trigger="load, click delay:1s"></div>
  * ```
  * This example will load `/news` immediately on page load, and then again with a delay of one second after each click.
  *
  * ### Via JavaScript
  *
  * The AJAX request can be triggered via JavaScript [`htmx.trigger()`](@/api.md#trigger), too.
  *
  * ## Notes
  *
  * * `hx-trigger` is not inherited
  * * `hx-trigger` can be used without an AJAX request, in which case it will only fire the `htmx:trigger` event
  * * In order to pass a CSS selector that contains whitespace (e.g. `form input`) to the `from`- or `target`-modifier, surround the selector in parentheses or curly brackets (e.g. `from:(form input)` or `from:closest (form input)`)
  * * A reset event in hx-trigger (e.g. hx-trigger="change, reset") might not work as intended, since HTMX builds its values and sends a request before the browser resets the form values. As a workaround, add a delay to let the browser reset the form before making the request (e.g. hx-trigger="change, reset delay:0.01s").

/** The `hx-vals` attribute allows you to add to the parameters that will be submitted with an AJAX request.
  *
  * By default, the value of this attribute is a list of name-expression values in [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
  * format.
  *
  * If you wish for `hx-vals` to *evaluate* the values given, you can prefix the values with `javascript:` or `js:`.
  *
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-vals='{"myVal": "My Value"}'>Get Some HTML, Including A Value in the Request</div>
  *
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-vals='js:{myVal: calculateValue()}'>Get Some HTML, Including a Dynamic Value from Javascript in the Request</div>
  * ```
  *
  * When using evaluated code you can access the `event` object. This example includes the value of the last typed key within the input.
  *
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-trigger="keyup" hx-vals='js:{lastKey: event.key}'>
  *     <input type="text" />
  *   </div>
  * ```
  *
  * You can also use the spread operator to dynamically specify values. This allows you to include all properties from an object returned by a function:
  *
  * ```html
  *   <div hx-get="/example" hx-vals='js:{...foo()}'>Get Some HTML, Including All Values from foo() in the Request</div>
  * ```
  *
  * In this example, if `foo()` returns an object like `{name: "John", age: 30}`, both `name` and `age` will be included as parameters in the request.
  *
  * ## Security Considerations
  *
  * * By default, the value of `hx-vals` must be valid [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON).
  *   It is **not** dynamically computed.  If you use the `javascript:` prefix, be aware that you are introducing
  *   security considerations, especially when dealing with user input such as query strings or user-generated content,
  *   which could introduce a [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability.
